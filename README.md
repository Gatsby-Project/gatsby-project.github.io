## Static Website Hosting through Github Pages
Static websites can also be hosted on GitHub with GitHub Pages. You can host a website on GitHub's `github.io` domain or a custom domain.

To host your website code on GitHub Pages, it is as simple as going to the settings within your repository and selecting the "Pages" option in the menu.
